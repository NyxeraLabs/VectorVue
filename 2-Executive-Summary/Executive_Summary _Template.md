* **Timeline:** Start and end dates of the operation.

### II. Overall Security Posture

* **Risk Rating:** A clear indicator (Critical / High / Medium / Low).

* **Business Risk:** Translate technical flaws into business consequences (e.g., "Potential for unauthorized wire transfers" instead of "Cross-Site Request Forgery").
