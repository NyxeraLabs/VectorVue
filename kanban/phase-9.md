## Sprint 9.1 — Attack Simulation Against System
Status: Done
Owner: José María Micoli
Risk Level: High
Security Impact: Enforces pre-promotion red-team attack simulation gates for critical telemetry and tenant-isolation controls.

### Tasks
- [x] Add replay attack simulation
- [x] Add signature forgery simulation
- [x] Add MITM fingerprint mismatch simulation
- [x] Add cross-tenant access simulation
- [x] Add tamper-log mutation simulation
- [x] Add queue poisoning simulation
- [x] Add rate limit exhaustion simulation
- [x] Enforce red-team suite in security CI workflow
- [x] Update sprint docs and architecture artifacts

### Validation Checklist
- [x] Security test added
- [ ] Manual verification done
- [x] No tenant boundary regression
